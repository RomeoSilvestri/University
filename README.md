# University Projects
Welcome to my repository of reports on the university projects I developed from 2019 to 2023 at the University of Padua and the "Sapienza" University of Rome. These projects were implemented using programming languages and analytical tools. Reports are mainly written in Italian. Below, you'll find a brief description of each of these projects.

## Analyzing Forecasting Models for Real Estate Markets: the Case Study of Madrid Prices
### Master's Thesis - R, OpenStreetMap - March 2023
The real estate market is a vital part of a country's economy that deals with the construction, management, and buying and selling of real estate properties that can be used for a multitude of purposes. In this context, the ability to accurately evaluate and predict the selling price of real estate has become a priority for professionals in the industry and investors. The price is often difficult to determine because it is influenced by a series of factors both internal and external to the property itself, such as its size, maintenance condition, geographic location, and economic situation. For this reason, statistical models are a useful tool to support predictive purposes.

In the context of this thesis, different predictive models for the real estate market will be compared to establish the value of homes as accurately as possible. In particular, attention will be paid to the spatial component, as the geographic location of the property is a key element in defining the selling price. Both traditional and spatial predictive models will be used. Traditional regression models have been widely used in this field and take into account the geographic location through the introduction of specific variables. On the other hand, spatial models incorporate information about the geographic proximity of observations directly into the construction method and explicitly express the intensity of these relationships through specific parameters. Therefore, it is interesting to study and compare these two different approaches.

Another important problem is represented by the management of missing data. In this type of problem, missing data is often present in large quantities, especially regarding information on internal characteristics of the property. The correct treatment of missing data is therefore an integral part of the analysis. This involves the need to use appropriate imputation techniques to estimate missing values.

The thesis will focus on the development of an application for the real estate market in Madrid. This city represents an extremely interesting geographic area with a varied, wide, and constantly evolving sector. Moreover, this study area is characterized by the availability of high-quality data from the main Spanish real estate portals. Such properties are described by numerous information, and unlike portals in other countries, the precise address of the home is often indicated.

In summary, this work can represent a contribution to improving the understanding of the real estate market and supporting investment decisions.

## Quality Assessment in the Statistical Register Construction Process
### ISTAT report - R - June 2022
The article discusses the importance of using administrative records for statistical purposes, and the need for quality evaluation tools to measure the accuracy and effectiveness of these records. In this context, the article examines the quality-framework of Statistics Austria presented in the Austrian Journal of Statistics in 2016 and proposes a possible application of this framework to the Italian Integrated System of Registries (SIR). The Statistics Austria quality-framework is a complex system consisting of three progressive phases: input, process, and output. The quality evaluation is carried out for each administrative record at the single-variable level, and four quality dimensions are identified: documentation, pre-processing, external sources, and imputation. The article focuses on the quality indicator for the first phase of the framework.

## Database Construction on NBA Games
### SQL (MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB) - May 2022

This work is based on the construction and interrogation of a database on NBA games between 2004 and 2021. The five tables that make up the database are downloaded from Kaggle at: [link text](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nathanlauga/nba-games).
The queries were proposed in order to answer possible questions of interest that may be asked of the database.
